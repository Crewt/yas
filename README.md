# YAS (Yet Another SLR (Software Language Repository))

YAS has been moved to https://github.com/softlang/yas in June 2016.
It has been developed in several locations prior to that over the years 2014-2016.

A software language repository (SLR) is a software repository for software languages: sample artifacts, definitions, implementations, and language processors for analysis and transformation. The SLR YAS (Yet Another SLR) is a mainly Prolog-based SLR which targets teaching and research on the foundations and engineering of software languages.
