# Headline 

An illustrative coupled transformation of a 101implementation

# Motivation

This 101contribution demonstrates a coupled software transformation for the 101implementation:xslt which exercises XML programming with XSLT. The coupled transformation is concerned with renaming element names and it operates at three levels: the instance level (XML documents), the type level (XML schemas, incidentally also XML documents), and the program level (XSLT programs, incidentally also XML documents). The transformation captures the element names under renaming in a level-specific manner. The transformation is implemented in Java with the help of the JDOM API.
