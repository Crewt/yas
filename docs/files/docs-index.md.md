# Languages

## Fabricated languages
* [ASL](languages/asl.html): A simple language for algebraic specification.
* [BAL](languages/bal.html): A trivial stack- and address-based assembly language; memory access and jumps use symbolic names rather than ints.
* [BCL](languages/bcl.html): A representation format for concrete syntax trees (CSTs) for BNF-like grammar notation as of BGL (Basic Grammar Language).
* [BFPL](languages/bfpl.html): A trivial first-order functional programming language with support for primitive types for integer and Boolean values, but without support for algebraic datatypes.
