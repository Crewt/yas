## Fabricated languages

* [BGL](languages/BGL.html): A BNF-like notation for context-free grammars; rules (productions) are labeled.
* [BIPL](languages/BIPL.html): A trivial imperative programming language with support for primitive types for integer and Boolean values, but without support for input, output, and procedures.
* [BML](languages/BML.html): A trivial stack- and address-based machine language; memory access and jumps use ints rather than symbolic names.

* [FRL](languages/FRL.html): A trivial data model for representing families as collections of persons with various attributes; persons are identified by reference as opposed to name.
* [FSML](languages/FSML.html): A simple domain-specific modeling language (DSML) for finite state machines (FSMs).

* [MMTL](languages/MMTL.html): A trivial transformation language for metamodels.
* [PPL](languages/PPL.html): A target language for pretty printing which provides different composition operators for textboxes.
* [TBL](languages/TBL.html): A trivial ontology-oriented language for representing collections of persons and their buddy relationships with a tree-based abstract syntax.
* [TDL](languages/TDL.html): A representation format for term differences.
* [TLL](languages/TLL.html): An applied, typed lambda calculus.
* [Term](languages/Term.html): Prolog terms as a basic representation format used by the YAS repository.
* [Text](languages/Text.html): Text as a basic representation format used by the YAS repository.
* [ULL](languages/ULL.html): An applied, untyped lambda calculus.
